# v-shield-auto

The following variables need to be assigned before beginning. The filename where the CVEs will be compiled, the host where the console is reached at, the registry name as it is known to Aqua, user & pass for the console and the severity you wish to create a v-shield rule.

It should create a few files to pull the full amount of data we need to iterate through the policy creation.

filename="highvuln_repo-micr_fixavailable.out"
host="http://console-url:port"
registryName="micr"
user="administrator"
